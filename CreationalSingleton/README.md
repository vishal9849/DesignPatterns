## CreationalSingleton Design Pattern
The CreationalSingleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when you want to control access to resources, manage a shared resource, or ensure that a class has a single point of control.

**Implementation**
The CreationalSingleton pattern typically involves the following components:

**Private Constructor**: The class has a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation from outside the class.

**Static Instance**: The class contains a static instance variable that holds the single instance of the class.

**Static Method**: A static method provides a way to access the singleton instance. This method typically uses lazy initialization to create the instance only when needed.

Usage
To use the CreationalSingleton pattern:

**Access CreationalSingleton Instance**: Access the singleton instance using the static method provided by the class.

```java
CreationalSingleton instance = CreationalSingleton.getInstance();
```
**Invoke Methods**: Call methods on the singleton instance as needed.

```
instance.doSomething();
```
## Advantages
**Global Access**: Provides a global point of access to a single instance, making it easy to access from anywhere in the application.

**Resource Efficiency**: Ensures that only one instance of the class is created, avoiding unnecessary resource consumption.

**Thread Safety**: Supports lazy initialization with thread-safe access to the singleton instance.

## Example Use Cases

**Logging**: A logging service that writes log messages to a file or system.

**Database Connection Pool**: Managing a shared pool of database connections.

**Configuration Management**: Providing global access to configuration settings.

**Resource Managers**: Managing and allocating shared resources like file handles or network connections.

## Limitations
**Global State**: Introduces global state, which can make testing more complex and increase coupling between components.

**Thread Safety**: Care must be taken to ensure thread safety, especially in multi-threaded environments
